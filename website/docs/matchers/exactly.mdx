# `expect.exactly(value)`

An asymmetric matcher that checks if the received value is exactly equal to the expected value, using `Object.is`.

Useful for situations where deep equality would typically be used, but you want to ensure that the values are the same reference.

<TestFile name="exactly">
{`
const ref = {}
const mock = jest.fn();
mock(ref);

it("is exactly equal", () => {
  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.exactly(ref));
  expect(mock).not.toHaveBeenCalledWith(expect.exactly({}));

  // this would normally pass
  expect(mock).toHaveBeenCalledWith({});
});
`}
</TestFile>
