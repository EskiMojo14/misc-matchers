# Enums

## `.toBeEnum(enum)`

Also available as an asymmetric matcher, `expect.ofEnum(enum)`.

Use `.toBeEnum` to assert that a value is a member of an enum.

<TestFile name="toBeEnum">
{`
enum Direction {
  Up,
  Down,
  Left,
  Right,
}

it("is a member of the enum", () => {
  expect(Direction.Up).toBeEnum(Direction);
});

/* or
enum Direction {
  Up = "UP",
  Down = "DOWN",
  Left = "LEFT",
  Right = "RIGHT",
}
*/

/* or
const Direction = {
  Up: "UP",
  Down: "DOWN",
  Left: "LEFT",
  Right: "RIGHT",
} as const;
*/
`}
</TestFile>

:::tip Aliasing `expect.ofEnum` to `expect.enum`


As `enum` is a reserved word in Javascript, it is not possible to export a matcher with this name. However, you can alias it in your setup file:

```js
import { ofEnum } from "mix-n-matchers";

expect.extend({ enum: ofEnum });
```

To add this to your `global.d.ts`:

```ts title="global.d.ts"
import type { AsymmetricMixNMatchers } from "mix-n-matchers";

declare global {
  namespace jest {
    export interface Expect {
      enum: AsymmetricMixNMatchers["ofEnum"];
    }

    interface InverseAsymmetricMatchers {
      enum: AsymmetricMixNMatchers["ofEnum"];
    }
  }
}
```

This approach can be adapted for Jest globals and Vitest as well.

After this setup, you should be able to use `expect.enum` as a matcher.

```ts
expect(mock).toBeCalledWith(expect.enum(MyEnum));
```

This is automatically done for you with the [auto-setup files](/#auto-setup).
