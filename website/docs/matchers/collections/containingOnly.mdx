# Containing Only

## `arrayContainingOnly`

An asymmetric matcher that checks if the received array contains only the expected values, using deep equality.

Values can be repeated (or omitted), but all elements should be present in the expected array.

:::note

Put another way, it checks that the received array is a subset of (or equal to) the expected array. This is in contrast to `arrayContaining`, which checks that the received array is a superset of (or equal to) the expected array.

:::

<TestFile name="arrayContainingOnly">
{`
it("contains only the expected values", () => {
  expect({ array: [1, 2] }).toEqual({
    array: expect.arrayContainingOnly([1, 2, 3]),
  });
  expect({ array: [1, 2] }).toEqual({
    array: expect.arrayContainingOnly([1, 2]),
  });
  expect({ array: [1, 1] }).toEqual({
    array: expect.arrayContainingOnly([1, 2, 2]),
  });
  
  expect({ array: [1, 2, 3] }).not.toEqual({
    array: expect.arrayContainingOnly([1, 2]),
  });
});
`}
</TestFile>

## `objectContainingOnly`

An asymmetric matcher that checks if the received object contains only the expected keys and values, using deep equality.

Keys can be repeated (or omitted), but all keys should be present in the expected object.

:::note

Put another way, it checks that the received object is a subset of (or equal to) the expected object. This is in contrast to `objectContaining`, which checks that the received object is a superset of (or equal to) the expected object.

:::

<TestFile name="objectContainingOnly">
{`
it("contains only the expected keys and values", () => {
  expect({ a: 1 }).toEqual(expect.objectContainingOnly({ a: 1, b: 2 }));
  expect({ a: 1, b: 2 }).toEqual(expect.objectContainingOnly({ a: 1, b: 2 }));

  expect({ a: 1, b: 2 }).not.toEqual(expect.objectContainingOnly({ a: 1 }));
});
`}
